  <h3>About the Club</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-8">
          <h4>Congratulations!</h4>

          <p>First of all, let me congratulate you as you have expressed an interest in one of the best karate clubs in the UK and the only one of its kind in the North East of England. The instruction given here is of the highest standard and is the result of our Chief Instructor spending six years training and teaching in Japan. He is also a qualified secondary school teacher with knowledge of different learning styles. At our club, we have members who train for many reasons. If you want to simply keep fit whilst learning a martial art that is fine. If you want to become a champion, that is fine too. We cater for all ages and abilities.</p>

          <p><strong>Your first lesson is free!</strong></p>

          <p>Once you have had your first lesson, we allow you four lessons to decide if you would like to join this unique club.</p>

          <p>At the moment we have students who only train once per week for one reason or another and this is absolutely fine. Those who do train only once per week, however, should remember the curriculum requires that in the early stages 48 hours of Dojo training is needed between gradings and twice that amount for higher grades.</p>

          <p>I am sure that you will agree that in order to become good at anything requires a certain level of dedication and it is hoped that by offering flexible payment methods we can help our students develop their skills in a way that best suits them.</p>

        <h4>Cost</h4>
        <p>The payment methods on offer at our club are as follows;

        <p>Seniors are charged at £35 and children up to 18yrs £25. This will be done in the form of a standing order that will be debited from a bank account once per month at a date suitable for you. These payments will allow students to train as often as they want (up to 4 times per week for juniors and 3 for adults, should they wish).</p>

        <p>Students who do not wish to take advantage of this method of payment and only wish to train as and when they can, will be charged at £6.00p (adult) and £5.00p (junior) per lesson. Usual fees for use of equipment only of £2 for seniors and £1 for juniors will apply to individuals training every Friday, who do not take advantage of the payment plan.</p>

        <p>A one-off joining fee to cover administration is charged at £10 for juniors and £20 for seniors.</p>

        <p>Standing order mandates for the monthly payments are provided and processed by the club so there is no need for you to contact your bank. It will all be done for you. There is no contract to sign and you will not be tied to any terms conditions.</p>

        <p>You will also be expected to join our karate organization. For the yearly fee, you will have insurance cover and will receive a membership card and passport in which to keep a record of your achievements. The junior application is £40 and yearly renewal is £20, the Senior application is £50 and yearly renewal is £30.</p>

        <p>We also recommend that you purchase a training suit, shin and instep pads and leather bag gloves to minimize injuries that may occur. They are available at reception.</p>

    <h4>Kyokushin Karate for Children and Young People</h4>
    <p>The increasing threats posed to children and young people in today’s society cause us all great concern and it seems that hardly a day goes by without another horrific story exposed in the media. Violence has become part of everyday life with the victims too often being innocent children. Unfortunately, our society has helped to grown some disruptive, undisciplined youngsters who cause misery to young and old alike.</p>

    <p>At the Chikara Dojo, we aim to teach our students the moral values too often missing in today’s society. We place great emphasis on respect for parents, family and friends, teachers, the law, senior citizens, peoples’ property and perhaps most importantly for themselves.</p>

    <p>We teach the threats caused by modern social issues such as substance abuse, bullying, strangers, unsafe play areas etc. We aim to make our students aware of the dangers that exist today and give them the confidence to try and deal with situations if they can not be avoided. Perhaps most importantly, the students are taught that fighting is only ever the last resort and that it is better to avoid danger in the first place. Our classes are composed of different sections, each with their own purpose.</p>

    <h4>What you will learn</h4>
    <p>Exercises including warm-ups and stretching are performed to improve fitness and maintain flexibility as well as to prepare the body for the training to follow.</p>

    <p>Fundamental techniques are taught in the form of blocks, punches, kicks, and strikes, teaching the students how to use their bodies, hands, feet, and elbows as natural weapons. Posture and balance are taught along with break falls, throws and restraint locks. Self-defense techniques are explained and practiced and sparring is performed with the emphasis placed on working with a partner so that both students can progress.</p>

    <p>Learning many kata (prearranged forms of attacks and defenses) requires dedication and discipline, each kata being more complex as progression is made.</p>

    <p>The students are encouraged by regular gradings where they are checked on physical performance, etiquette and manners, kihon (basic techniques) kata and kumite (sparring). They are awarded a succession of belts from orange up to black, which indicates their progress.</p>

    <p>We offer disciplined training sessions, suitable for students of all ages where they will not only learn but also have fun.</p>

    <p>We aim to develop good characters in our students, the result of which will show in their attitude at home and in school. Bullying in any form is not tolerated and any student found to be bullying will be severely dealt with. The etiquette and code of conduct required in classes is of a very high standard and the students quickly learn self-discipline. This can be seen in the excellent manners of even our youngest students.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to provide a safe, disciplined, fun way of learning Kyokushin Karate as a true Martial Art to help our students grow into mature, well-mannered individuals with the hope that we can help build a better community.</p>

    <p>We hope this information has been useful to you and we look forward to seeing you.</p>
